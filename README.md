I use event storming to analyze this assignment and, I prefer elasticsearch as Query part of this. For this assignment I do not wrote any command as in assignment description they do not ask.

How To Start:
===
Run following command:
> make set-up

note: if you do not want docker, just make sure elasticsearch is installed and configured. 

API:
